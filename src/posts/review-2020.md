This time last year our lives were completely different.  <br>
I was working in a call center, in an office, of course -working from home was simply not an option- and all I could think of was getting out of that place to dedicate my time to something that made me happier: coding. I started to learn HTML and CSS in summer 2019 and it was life-changing.  <br> <br>
I was accepted in a bootcamp that would start in mid February, and I was fully focused on completing the pre-course tasks.  <br> <br>
And Covid-19 came in to change it all and to change us all.  <br> <br>
We started to work from home, some people were losing their jobs, less companies were hiring, left alone the deaths. The scenario changed dramatically and suddenly my goal of getting my first job in 2020 seemed ridiculously harder... But I was so focused on achieving my goal that I didn't even worry about the possibility of not achieving it, it may sound weird, but that's exactly how I felt. I believe my focus got me through those crazy and uncertain months and I'm grateful for it.  <br> <br>
At the end of the course, we presented our final projects and we had the chance to interview with one of the companies that sponsored the program. They would select 2 out of 15 people, so the chance was there.  <br> <br>
After the end of the selection process, we were told that 5 of us had been selected and I was one of them! I was over the moon and looking forward to starting my new job.  <br> <br>
This experience taught me that anyone can do or get anything they want, no matter how difficult it may seem, you just need to believe and work toward your goal. As my dad always says: the universe will conspire to help you achieve it.  <br> <br>
2020 was also the year I started drawing. Yes, me, drawing. I always thought I would never be able to draw, but with patience and discipline, anything is possible.  <br> <br>
Other things I'm happy I've done this year:
- My blog
- I read 22 books
- I finally bought my first shares!
- I ran 100k/year
- I'm vegetarian

 We also had the opportunity to travel to Turkey in January 2020 and back home in August. I wish I could have travelled more in 2020, I miss travelling so much but I'm hopeful we'll be able to travel again very soon and we'll enjoy it even more than before. <br> <br>
I'm looking forward to 2021 and to some light after this long tunnel. <br> <br>
